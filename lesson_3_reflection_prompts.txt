When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others, when local storage is not secure, when building a portfolio, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pulling would be useful in case a mistake has been made in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Both forks and clones are copies of repositories. Clones refer to those existing locally (e.g. on my computer) and forks are on GitHub. Branches are a stream of commits.
    
    I would use forks to create my own version of someone else's code. If trying to contribute to that other person's project, I would clone it and push it their directly. Branches can be made when trying an alternative method.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It informs me how many commits I made on the remote. Also, having such a
copy allows pulling remote without affecting local changes committed

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would send and receive snippets of modified codes. The easier part would
be not having to deal with GitHub interface or us Git commands. The harder part
would be (1) to figure out exact changes and where the changes were made, (2) to
track details of changes and who made the changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I would make changes in a separate branch when I am collaborating with
others on GitHub. This way, I can ensure that only the changes approved by
others on GitHub are applied to the master. Benefit of this approach
is that any changes to master are likely to to be "good enough". On the other
hand, changing the master branch directly is procedurally less complicated.
