When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others, when local storage is not secure, when building a portfolio, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pulling would be useful in case a mistake has been made in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Both forks and clones are copies of repositories. Clones refer to those existing locally (e.g. on my computer) and forks are on GitHub. Branches are a stream of commits.
    
    I would use forks to create my own version of someone else's code. If trying to contribute to that other person's project, I would clone it and push it their directly. Branches can be made when trying an alternative method.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
